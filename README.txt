js.gridster
***********

Introduction
============

This library packages `gridster`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`gridster`: https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.gridster``) are published to some URL.

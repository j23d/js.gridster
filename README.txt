Introduction
============

This library packages `gridster`_ for `fanstatic`_.

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.gridster``) are published to some URL.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
